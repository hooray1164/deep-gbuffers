# Implementation of Mara et al: Fast Global Illumination Approximations on Deep G-Buffers
See report.pdf for more information. This project was built using the [Glitter](https://github.com/Polytonic/Glitter) template, as a final project for CMPSC 280 (Advanced Computer Graphics, UCSB, Professor Pradeep Sen).

Above: Single-scatter radiosity using multiple layers.

Below: Benefit of using multiple layers on McGuire et. al.â€™s Scalable Ambient Obscurance (2012). Ambient Occlusion from both layers (top), only the first layer (middle) and only the second layer (bottom). The red box highlights an area where the second layer provided a very noticeable correction to an error in a single layer only approach.
